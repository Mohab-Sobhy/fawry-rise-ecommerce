# fawry-rise-ecommerce

A console-based Java application simulating a basic e-commerce system, developed as part of the **Fawry Rise Internship Challenge**.

## 🧠 System Design Overview

The system follows Object-Oriented Programming principles and design patterns:

* **Strategy Pattern** for product expiry behavior (`IExpiry`)
* **Adapter Pattern** for shipping company integration
* **Observer Pattern** for checkout notifications
* **Singleton Pattern** for services like `CheckoutService` and `ShippingService`
